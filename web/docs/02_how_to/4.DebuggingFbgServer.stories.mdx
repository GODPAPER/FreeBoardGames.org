# Setup
You can manually start only the backend by going to the `fbg-server` folder and using `yarn run start`.

In order to only run the unit tests for the fbg-server, you can use `yarn run jest` in that folder.

# Debugging GraphQL queries

For manually testing the GraphQL queries, you can access the GraphQL console at http://localhost:3001/graphql.

Create a user with this query:

```
mutation newUser($nickname: String!) {
  newUser(user:{nickname:$nickname}){
    jwtToken
  }
}
```

with the variables below:

```
{
  "nickname": "hello"
}
```

You can authenticate with this user for the next query by copying the JWT value returned and setting the header like below:

```
{"authorization": "Bearer JWT_VALUE"}
```

Replace the `JWT_VALUE` from the previous query.

An instance of a query for fetching the current user data:
```
query getUser {
  user {
    id,
    nickname
  }
}
```

Use the right tab on the console to see all possible queries.
