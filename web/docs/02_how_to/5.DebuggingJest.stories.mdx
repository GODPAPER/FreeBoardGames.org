# Debugging

## VS Code

I found the following techniques helpful in understanding vscode debugging integration with jest test modules.  There are fancier vscode extensions (e.g. vscode-jest) that worked slick, but were a lot harder to understand in configuration -- this method uses a seperate launch configuration that you can execute from the debug console on the open test. Add this fragment to the launch.json inside the configurations property.

It's worth noting that I struggled with the workspace configurations until I mounted the workspace at sub-project folder `FreeBoardgames.org/web` making web the root of the workspace.

```JSON
/** launch.json **/

{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [{
      "name": "Jest Debug opened file",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js",
      "args": ["src/games/<your-game>/${fileBasenameNoExtension}", "--runInBand", "--no-cache"],
      "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
      "protocol": "inspector",
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen"
    }, /*   ...others    */]
}
