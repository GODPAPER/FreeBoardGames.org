Install docker, minikube, and helm.

Install minikube ingress extension:
``minikube addons enable ingress``

Compile the docker images locally using:
``./docker-build.sh``
on the root folder. When asked by the script, upload the images to minikube. This will make it possible to run your local code on minikube.

Create a new helm release, in the root:
``helm install my-fbg ./helm``

Run:
``kubectl get ingress``

It should return something like (might take some minutes):
```
NAME              CLASS    HOSTS              ADDRESS        PORTS   AGE
my-fbg-ingress    <none>   my-fbg.info        172.17.0.15    80      38s
```

Add the line below to your ``/etc/hosts``, replacing the ``172.17.0.15`` with the address you obtained from the ingress:
```
172.17.0.15    my-fbg.info
```

Now acccess ``https://my-fbg.info``. Because you don't actually own this domain, LetsEncrypt wont emit a certificate and you will get a certificate error on the browser. 

To skip the error, type ``thisisunsafe`` (Chrome). You should be able to access fbg running in your kubernetes cluster now!
