You might want to run your dev instance in a different domain than `localhost`. However, you will run into errors if you try to do so directly, as browsers don't allow web sockets over plain HTTP.
In order to fix this issue, we need to install nginx as a reverse proxy and use let's encrypt to get us valid SSL certificates.


# Dependencies 

In a fresh VM with Ubuntu, install all our dependencies:

- NVM: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm and use Node LTS
- Yarn: `npm install --global yarn`
- Autoconf and build essentials: `sudo apt install autoconf build-essential`
- Nginx: `sudo apt install nginx`

Make sure your domain is pointing to your VM and the VM has no firewall protecting port 80 and 443.
Then, check that the nginx is working by using `curl http://your.domain` on another computer

Now, we need to enable HTTPS. Follow the tutorial here to use Let's Encrypt:
https://www.nginx.com/blog/using-free-ssltls-certificates-from-lets-encrypt-with-nginx/

Check that it worked by using a browser and navigatting to http**s**://your.domain

Change `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` and only use these `location`s on the https server configuration:

```
location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;
}
location /graphql {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3001/graphql;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
}
location /socket.io {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8001/socket.io;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
}
```

Dont forget to restart nginx after: `sudo service nginx restart`

Now, we need to run FBG. Clone our repo:

`git clone https://github.com/freeboardgames/FreeBoardGames.org.git`

Install node modules:

`cd FreeBoardgames.org && yarn install`

Run dev:

`BGIO_PUBLIC_SERVERS=https://your.domain yarn run dev checkers`

Now you should be able to access FBG at https://your.domain !
