# Docker Setup

To build an docker image all dependencies must be installed and installed before the docker build process. Run the gameserver  once locally to compile.

```bash
yarn install && yarn run gen:games
```

First build a the common `fbg-common` docker image.

```bash
docker build -t fbg-common:latest ./common
```

Now the images from the compose file can be build.

```bash
cp docker-compose.yml.example docker-compose.yml
docker-compose build
```

The previous steps can be also called by a setup script:

```bash
./docker-build.sh
```


After that you can push the images to a repository:

```bash
./docker-build.sh -p
```

After the build process the server can be started via docker compose.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Usage:

```bash
Usage: ./docker-build.sh -[d|b|e|i|r|h]

   -d,    Installs dependencies and run the webserver and backend.
   -b,    Build docker image
   -p,    Push docker images
   -e,    Export build docker images
   -i,    Import docker images
   -r,    Prune docker images
   -h,    Print this help text

If the script will be called without parameters, it will run:
    ./docker-build.sh -d -b
```
