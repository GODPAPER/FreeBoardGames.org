    "text": "*For the original rules of the game, see here: https://gamewright.com/pdfs/Rules/SushiGoTM-RULES.pdf. The differences between Sushi Go and Picnic Go are mainly cosmetic.*\n\nPicnic Go is a simple deckbuilding game, where the goal is to build the most delicious meal you can! Everyone picks a card from their hand, and reveals their selected card at the same time. Then, the cards are passed clockwise (or, in the case of this implementation, from top to bottom), and play continues until every card is exhausted. After three rounds, whoever has the highest score wins! (In case of ties, compare amount of cupcakes.)\n\nThe cards available for you to pick from are:\n- **Sandwiches** - *Chicken Sandwiches* (triangle) are worth *1 point*. *Pork Sandwiches* (square) are worth *2 points*. *Beef Sandwiches* (circle) are worth *3 points*.\n- **Mayonnaise** - *Triples* the next sandwich you pick. Cannot stack with other mayonnaise.\n- **Potato Chips** - At the end of a round, the player with the most chips scores *6 points*, and the player with the second most chips scores *3 points*. If there's a tie, split the score evenly, rounded down.\n- **Deviled Eggs** - Each set of 2 is worth *5 points.* Otherwise, worth no points.\n- **Fried Chicken** - Each set of 3 is worth *10 points.* Otherwise, worth no points.\n- **Pizza** - A set of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 or more is worth *1, 3, 6, 10,* and *15 points*, respectively.\n- **Cupcake** - Keep until the end of the game. At the end, the player with the most cupcakes scores *6 points*. If playing with more than 2 players, the player with the least cupcakes *lose 6 points.* If there's a tie, split the score evenly, rounded down.\n- **Fork** - Scores nothing, but can be used at a later turn. On use, you're allowed to pick 2 cards this turn, then return the fork to your hand.\n\nAll card art is made by ProspectPyxis, and is licensed under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)."
