Bombs and Bunnies is a game of bluffing, mind games and surprising strategy.

Each round players will take it in turn to place their cards face down.
Someone can then make a bet as to how many cards they can turn over without revealing a bomb.
Players will have the opportunity to raise or skip the bet.
If a player reveals a bomb, the bomb's owner will discard a random card of that player.

To win the game a player must either 
- Successfully meet their bet twice
- All other players run out of cards
