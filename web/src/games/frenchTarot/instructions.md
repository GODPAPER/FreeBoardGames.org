The following description is a shortened version of the text on John McLeod's
wonderful web site on card games: https://www.pagat.com/tarot/frtarot.html

French Tarot is a trick-taking game in which the partnerships vary from hand to
hand.

French Tarot is most commonly played by four players (however, it is also common
for five to play, and it is also possible for three).
In each hand one player (the taker) plays alone against the other three in
partnership.
The taker's objective is to accumulate enough card points to win the hand by
taking tricks. 

Each round players will take it in turn to play cards into the middle (the trick).
Each trick is won by the highest trump in it, or the highest card of the suit
led if no trumps were played. The winner of a trick leads to the next.

You have to follow suit if you can, and if you have no cards of the suit which
was led you must play a trump. If trumps are led, the other players must of
course follow with trumps if they can.

There is a further restriction: whenever you have to play a trump (either
because trumps were led or because you have no cards of the suit which was led),
you must if possible play a trump which is higher than the highest trump so far
played to the trick. If you are unable to do this, you are free to play any
trump, but you must still play a trump, even though you cannot win the trick
with it.
