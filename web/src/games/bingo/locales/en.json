Each player gets a card with numbers arranged in a 5x5 table, and is required to marker the announced number. The computer then calls out a number and each player then marks the called letter on their card if it is present. If a player has 5 in a row they call out “BINGO” (by pressing the shout button). \n\nImage credits [Freepik](http://www.freepik.com)"
